# 🌤️ Real-Time Weather Forecast Dashboard using Weather API

![Dashboard Preview](Images/report.png)

## 📌 Project Description

The **Real-Time Weather Forecast Dashboard** is a fully interactive Power BI report powered by a live **Weather API**, offering a deep dive into **current weather conditions**, **14-day forecasts**, and **air quality indexes** for selected cities across India.

Built for clarity and engagement, this dashboard allows users to monitor real-time environmental metrics, assess air pollution levels, and plan activities based on weather and precipitation insights — all dynamically controlled through slicers, dropdowns, and bookmarks.
